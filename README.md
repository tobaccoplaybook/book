# Tobacco Control Playbook

While the tobacco industry and its allies have always opposed tobacco control measures, their strategies have now become more determined, focussed, misleading, aggressive and sophisticated.

Until now there has been no single source explaining how tobacco industry players act and how governments and the public health community can respond to their arguments.

The **Tobacco Control Playbook** is a living collection of evidence-based arguments and responses, developed by tobacco control leaders to counteract and succeed against the tobacco industry.

## Technical overview

The Master branch of this repository holds the publishing system, and the live website is served from the `docs/` folder.  

The domain name `tobaccoplaybook.net` resolves to cloudfront.com, who provides a cache and the https-rewrite service.  

The website is a static site, generated by the custom builder (`src/build.js`) run by node.js.

Configure settings in `config.js`.  

Site content is in a separate "content-repo" at  [tobaccoplaybook/content](https://github.com/tobaccoplaybook/content).

## Authoring

All content is expressed in Markdown files, located in the following directories below content-repo (as configured in `config.js > contentSource`):  

| Dir 	          	| Description	  	|
| -------------- 	| -------------- 	|
|Â /en, /ru			| available languages. Subdirs structure is expected to match. |
| front				| content for the index page |
| pages				| content for auxiliary pages, e.g. About |
| arguments			| main content files |


### Frontmatter

All files accept [YAML frontmatter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/front-matter)


| Key           | Example 		| Description |
| ------------- | ----------- 	| ------------|

#### Naming convention

`langugage`/arguments/`000`\_name_of_this_page.md, where:  
- `language` is a directory containing all content files for a given language (e.g. 'en')  
- `000` denotes a *unique* page ID


Examples:  

/en/arguments/001_page_number_one.md  
/en/arguments/002_page_number_two.md  
/no/arguments/001_side_nummer_en.md  
/no/arguments/002_side_nummer_to.md  


## Installing the system

Make sure your system has a working installation of [node, npm](https://nodejs.org/), [sh and git](https://git-scm.com/download/).  

To find out, type

	$ node --version
	# (v7.4.0 or later is recommended)

Make sure your git is setup and working too.

Then obtain the source code:

	# Create a project directory:
	$ mkdir tobaccoplaybook-project
	$ cd tobaccoplaybook-project

	# Get a copy of the repositories
	$ git clone https://github.com/tobaccoplaybook/site.git
	$ git clone https://github.com/tobaccoplaybook/content.git

	# Install its dependencies:
	$ cd site
	$ npm install


#### Building the site

	$ node index.js
	# (or npm start)

This will start the dev server, which  
- Rebuilds the site into `build/`  
- Starts a live-reload server (so you can browse the result) at [http://127.0.0.1:8181/](http://127.0.0.1:8181/)  
- Starts a file wathcer, that rebuilds when sourcefiles change.  


#### Publishing the site

Use the included `deploy.sh` script to commit and push all local changes live-reload.

	$ ./deploy.sh

Use the included `publish.sh` script to publish the local website

	$ ./publish.sh
